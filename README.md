# Ecommerce-Hypothesis-Analysis
**Professional Context**
- Program: TripleTen Data Analyst Bootcamp.
- Standards: This project was developed as a professional-grade simulation designed to meet the analytical requirements of high-scale, Fortune 500-level retail environments.
- Quality Assurance: The methodology, statistical logic, and Python code underwent rigorous expert peer review to ensure conclusions meet industry standards for data integrity.

**Executive Summary**
This project identifies high-impact growth strategies for an online store through a dual-phase analytical approach. I first prioritized nine business hypotheses using the ICE and RICE frameworks to ensure efficient resource allocation based on reach and impact. Subsequently, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of an A/B test, evaluating cumulative revenue and conversion metrics. By applying statistical significance tests to both raw and filtered data, I provided a data-driven recommendation on whether to stop or continue the test based on stabilized performance trends.

**Technical Stack**
- Language: Python 3.9.
- Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy.
- Methodology: ICE/RICE Frameworks, Cumulative Metric Analysis, Z-test for Statistical Significance, Data Cleaning/Anomaly Detection.

**Key Results**
Hypothesis Prioritization: Successfully re-ranked business objectives using the RICE framework, identifying "Add a subscription form to all main pages" as the highest-reach opportunity.

**Data Integrity:** 
Validated the A/B test groups by identifying and handling users who appeared in both segments, ensuring the accuracy of the conversion data.

**Statistical Significance:** 
Found a statistically significant difference in conversion rates between Group A and Group B, providing a clear signal for the business decision.

**Business Impact:** 
Concluded the test with a recommendation to stop the trial and crown a winner, as the cumulative metrics demonstrated stabilization and a clear performance advantage.

**Language Note**
The technical documentation and code comments in the accompanying .ipynb file are written in Spanish, as the original project instructions and requirements were provided in that language.
